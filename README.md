# Deep-CLO : A Framework for Deep Curriculum Learning Optimization and Input Manipulation 


**The framework, Deep-CLO, in the context of deep learning, has three applications:** 

1. **Deep-CLO** – an end-to-end curriculum training in which a batch-based syllabus (ordering of samples by some 
measure) is combined with deep learning to train networks. 
2. **POR** – an algorithm used to preprocess a training sample by proposing image regions (patches) that are then 
analyzed, reorganized, and stitched back together to generate a new training sample. 
3. **FM-POR** – this is like POR except it is implemented as network operation that transforms feature maps.
